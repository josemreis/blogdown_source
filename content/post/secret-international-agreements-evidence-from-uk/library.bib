abstract = {Over the past fifty years, barriers to international trade have decreased substantially. A key source of this decline in protectionism has been the proliferation of agreements among countries to liberalize commerce. In this article, we analyze the domestic political conditions under which states have concluded such agreements and, more generally, explore the factors affecting interstate economic cooperation. We argue that interstate cooperation on commercial issues depends heavily on the political regime types of participants: as states become more democratic, they are increasingly likely to conclude trade agreements. To test our claim, we examine whether the regime types of states have influenced their propensity to form and expand preferential trading arrangements (PTAs) during the period since World War II. We find that democratic countries are about twice as likely to form a PTA as autocratic countries, and that pairs of democracies are roughly four times as likely to do so as autocratic pairs. These results provide strong evidence that democracies are more commercially cooperative than less democratic countries.},

Litigation is costly and does not reveal private information. The court's ruling is not binding and bargaining can occur before and after the court has ruled. Nevertheless, an alternative dispute resolution mechanism emerges: court rulings can coordinate endogenous multilateral enforcement. Disinterested states will enforce to ensure that they can profitably use the court in the future. Accepting jurisdiction of the court allows a state to make efficiency-enhancing "trades," winning high-value disputes in exchange for losing low-value disputes. This is possible because litigation is a screening device: states only sue when they derive relatively high value from the disputed asset. The use of the court as a coordination device for multilateral enforcement allows for the existence of a court with endogenous enforcement and jurisdiction.},

abstract = {Abstract Why are extremists able to sabotage peace processes in some cases but not others? And under what conditions will the public respond to such provocation and return to unpopular wars? We seek to show that extremist violence is not indiscriminate or irrational as many people have assumed but quite strategic. We argue that extremist violence intentionally plays on the uncertainty that exists between the more moderate groups who are attempting to negotiate a peace agreement. Using a game-theoretic model of the interaction of extremist violence and mistrust, we identify the conditions under which extremists will succeed and fail. We find that extremists are most likely to succeed in derailing a peace process when the targeted side believes that opposition moderates are strong. At these times, the public perceives moderates as best able to control and suppress extremists within their own ranks. When moderates are viewed as weak and unable to crack down on extremists, terrorism is more likely to fail. We discuss this finding, as well as a number of additional implications of the model, in connection with the Israeli-Palestinian case.},

annote = {a) Why it matters?

Very good literature review of the research on transparency and IOs, namely why it appears in some but not others as well as its impacts. Among the main questions answered by this literature are: How can this development be explained? What are the principal patterns in IO
transparency and openness? How does transparency and openness impact on the accountability, effectiveness, and legitimacy of IOs?

b) Main takeaways

Theoretical appraoches to transparency and openness

(i) Rational choice institutionalism

In a nutshell contribution in the rational institutionalism tradition direct our attention to the benefits and costs of transparency and openness in IOs. In this logic, transparency and openness is a dimension of the institutional design of IOs on which states make deliberate and informed chouces, based on a cost-benefit calculations
According to research in the rational institutionalist tradition, we can find functional
benefits of non-state access in three of the four principal phases of the policy process: policy formulation,
implementation, and monitoring and enforcement. This stemms from: (i) functional benefits from access of non-staes actors due to their policy expertise - and this benefit is particularly acute where uncertainty about the state of the world exists (see koremenos) -. a proeminent example being in environmental policy; (ii) IOs may open-up to TNAs in the implementation phase, to elicit their help in the execution of programs and delivery of services in the field; (iii) IOs may delegate monitoring and enforcement duties to IOs, as they have resources and incentives to monitor (fire alarm) defections and to informally raise the costs of non-compliance (e.g. naming and shaming).

As for the costs. This literature highlights three main ones. First, sovereignity costs, that is costs associated with the reduction in state control. In a closed setting, the participating governments have a monopoly on the information collected and generated by IOs, and, with transparency, they loose such control. The sovereignity costs of openness accross policy function and issue areas, namely: (i) they should be very high in decision-making, where states adopt binding rules, in particular if monitoring and strong enforcement is involved; (ii) relatively lower in implementation; (iii) and even lower in policy formulation. Moreover, the sovereignity costs will also depend on the salience, due to historical, cultural, and functional reasons, of the issue at had - the costs should be the highest when issues touch ipon elements of westphalian sovereignty.
Second, transparency also involves organizational costs, namely costs associated with setting up and implementing public information policies in IOs which entail material costs.
Thirdly, "posturing costs". As stasavage shows, transparency may incentivize the representatives of the jurisdictions which are bargaining an IA to posture to its domestic audiences. This may lead to bargaining break-downs ans welfare losses. 

(ii) Sociological institutionalism

Sociological institutionalism (and related work in the constructivist tradition) offers an alternative theoretical perspective on transparency and openness in IOs. Rather than focusing on benefits and costs, this approach privileges the emergence and spread of norms of transparency and inclusiveness in global governance. Actors adopt institutional norms, either because they have internalized them as the "right thing to do", or because they have learned what is expected of them. The spread of norms about appropriate institutions gives rise to isomorphism, or the homogenization of institutional models across functional domains.
According to contributions in this tradition, recent decades have witnessed the
emergence of a new norm about what constitutes legitimate global governance. This argument comes in two forms: (i) In the first version, member states and IO bureaucracies have introduced and expanded
transparency and openness because they have become socialized into believing in the normative appropriateness of this model (Johnston 2001; Checkel 2005; Goodman and Jinks 2013). Which , it may result from the emergence of a new openness discourse in a set of influential IOs, and its subsequent spread in the broader population of organizations. In this process, activists, academics, and policy-makers alike may have functioned as norm entrepreneurs, criticizing intergovernmental representation, diagnosing democratic deficits, offering institutional remedies, and exchanging reform experiences; an alternative source of norm socialization is democracy at the domestic level.
According to this argument, the development of a norm of transparent and inclusive governance reflects the presence and influence of democratic states within international organizations. (ii) A second constructivist argument, states that the shift toward openness and transparency in global governance does not reflect socialization of policy-makers into a new norm, as much as adaptation to it for purposes of legitimation. A loss in the perceived legitimacy of an IO can negatively affect its capacity to garner political support for an ambitious policy agenda, reduce the ability of government leaders to secure the popular support needed to ratify new treaties, and hurt the chances of effective implementation of international rules and requirements in the member states.

(iii) Normative democratic theory

Democratic theory addresses the normative aspects of transparency and openness in IOs. Normative democratic theory is not a unified approach, but consists of several different strands of theory, often described as alternative models of democracy, which offer competing prescriptions for how the ideal democracy should be designed.

Empirical study of transparency and openness

MUITO IMPORTANTE: Perhaps the most common finding is evidence of an increase in IO transparency and openness over time. It has become very common over the past two decades to claim that global governance is becoming increasingly transparent and inclusive. In a first generation of contributions, this observation was primarily based on evidence from individual IOs, such as the EU, the WTO, the World Bank, and the UN.46 Recently however, this claim has been subject to more systematic, large- n assessments, which have corroborated the earlier picture of a transformation in the institutional design of IOs (p.16).

MUITO IMPORTANTE: Using their large-n dataset, tallberg et al. (2013) find that transparency in IOs is mostly recent, very broad, and show no sign of ending. While the share of IO bodies with some level of openness was at 20 percent in 1950, this doubled to about 40 percent in 1990, and then almost doubled again over the next twenty years, to 70 percent in 2010. At the level of IOs, they find that almost all organizations today offer formal access in some form. And if measurement of access is expanded to include informal procedures and practices, then hardly any IO or IO body remains closed to non-state actors. The leaders in this historical development have been a set of large western or global IOs – the UN, the Council of Europe, the Organization of American States (OAS), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) – for which non-state access was an institutional feature of some significance already in the decades after World War II. Tallberg et al. conclude that the opening up of IOs over the past two decades has been broad and comprehensive, pervading all issue areas, all policy functions, all forms of IO bodies, and all world regions.

MUITO IMPORTANTE. Exploring an important subset of this development, Alter similarly finds that growing private access to international courts and tribunals is a distinct trend, with nearly all new courts created since 1990 offering direct mechanisms for individuals, NGOs, or firms. (Alter 2006).

MUITO IMPORTANTE: Green finds a similar pattern when assessing delegation to private actors in about 150
multilateral environmental treaties over the past century. 49 The proportion of policy functions delegated by states to private actors has grown remarkably over the past quarter-century in this domain, and particularly since the early 1990s. This

MUITO IMPORTANTE: Existing research on access to documentation in IOs points to a pattern of expansion as
well. (Grigorescu 2007) During the post-World War period and up until the late 1980s, the transparency policies of IOs were predominantly based on the presumption that information should be kept secret and public access an exception. Yet, from around 1990, it became increasingly common for IOs to adopt public information policies. The World Bank was the first major IO to adopt such a policy in 1993, and its move was soon followed by the regional development banks.51 In the late 1990s, the IMF began to promote transparency as well – not only on the part of member governments, but also on the part of the IO itself.52 Following the pattern among development banks, the United Nations Development Program became the first major agency to adopt a comprehensive public information policy in 1997. Several other agencies soon followed. At regional level, the EU surrendered its traditional culture of secrecy in 2001, when adopting Regulation 1049/2001 on public access to information, and access to both documentation and deliberations has subsequently continued to expand.

Muito importante: Steffek (2013) presents findings from a cross-issue area comparison of civil society access to more than 30 IOs. The results point to significat variation between policy fields. There is high level of non-state involvement in environmental policy institutions and processes, such as the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the UNFCCC; the same can be said about human rights. By contrast, in security, that does not happen ( NATO), and the same seems to occur in areas such as finance (IMF).

Muito importante: tallberg et al. (2013) corroborate the existence of distinct patterns across issue areas.55 They find that, in 2010, IO bodies in the field of human rights were by far the most open. Multi-issue bodies were the second most open category, followed by development and trade. The lowest levels of openness could be found in finance and security. All issue areas have followed the same clear trend of an increase in openness over time, most notably after 1990. At a closer look, three additional patterns in the temporal development are observed. First, IO bodies in human rights and development, as well as multi-issue bodies, have been pioneers of non-state access. Second, early differences in access have proven highly resilient over time, as IO bodies in some fields consistently have been the most open (human rights) or the most closed (security, finance). Third, unlike the overall trend of a steep increase from 1990 onwards, access in some fields, such as environmental politics and commodity regulation, grew in a more linear way. Other issue areas, such as trade and security, have experienced a late and rather abrupt opening up. Existing research points to differences across policy functions; n this vein, it has been established that IO bodies involved in monitoring and enforcement of member state compliance have been by far the most open category from 1950 to 2010. The second most open category in 2010, and during the first two decades of the observation period, was implementation bodies. Finally, the least open policy function in international cooperation has consistently been decision-making.

abstract = {AbstractThe question posed in this article is how to explain that the governance of secrecy in EU external relations varies. While the Common Foreign and Security Policy appears to retain its secretive character, the EU's external trade policy has recently seen a shift towards more transparency. This article argues that to understand this variation, one has to take into account the institutional power of the European Parliament as well as the extent to which the rules and practices of secrecy are perceived as legitimate. The empowerment of the Parliament in trade means that it has had recent success in pushing back secrecy in this area. However, a general finding is that the majority of parliamentarians seem only rarely to question the executive's governance of secrecy in external relations. The analysis shows that perceptions of legitimacy are crucial to account for different secrecy regimes – a finding that is likely to be relevant for the understanding of secrecy in foreign policy beyond the EU.},

It assesses the impact of transparency in international negotiations. Its theoretical models so it reveals the hidden costs of transparent bargaining, in particular how transparency may incentivize the adoption of uncompromising positions by the bargainers (posturing), with the underlying intent of signalling honesty to their domestic constituents, which may lead to negotiations of welfare enhancing agreements being breaking down.

b) Research questions and methodology

R.Q.: What is the impact of transparency in the bergaining behavior of state representatives?
Methodolog: game theory + (poor) qualitative analysis

c) Main takeaway(s)

In the model 2 jusrisdictions (A and B) must bargain over a policy choice. The bargaining is conducted by a representative, randomly selected, of each jurisdiction ("representative") on behalf of the constituency (principal). The model assumes that the public a prefer policy 0 and that of B 1. Given policy choice x, public from jurisdiction A receives utility (1 - x) and that of B receives x. Information regarding te minimum acceptable offer for each jurisdiction is private information. One of the representative, B, chooses one policy x {\{}0,1{\}}, and the other, say A, may only accept or reject. Ex post the jurisdictions will assess if the reprensentatives decisions was "biased". The model assumes information asymmetries regarding the preferences of the representative, namely that (the public of each jurisdiction is unsure as to the real preferences of their representatives. The model assumes taht with a probability p the representative share the preferences of the public from A, and with probability (1-p) she is biased and prefers the outcome 1. The representative derives her utility from the outcome x as well as the assessment of the bias post negotiation by the jurisdiction pr(u/x,o), which represents reputation. Moreover, given the proximity and exchange of ideas in the bargaining, it is assumed that each player receives a signal of the disagreement payoff of the opposite side

Stages of the game

1 nature chooses the type of Ra and determines the disagreement payoffs
2 Ra and Rb receive the signals about the disagreement payoff of the other jurisdiction 
Ra or Rb are randomly selected to propose x
4 if accepted, the proposal is implemented
5 Under open door bargaining the public observes "o" (the offer made) and "x" (the policy outcome), under closed they can just observe "x" (the outcome)

Perfect Bayesian Equilibria and propositions

p1 Open-door ensures that the rep will make proposals close to the (by the jurisdiction) prefered outcomes provided that the parameter for reputation (ex post avaliation of bias) is large

p2 Open-door willprompt rep to posture provided reputaitonal concerns are sufficiently strong and public perceives a risk of bias

Endogeneizing - the demand for transparency

p4 it follows that the public will prefer open-door bargaining if there is significantly risk of bias and reputational concerns are strong enough

p5 representative will prefer closed-door if reputational concerns are sufficiently strong

abstract = {There is heated debate over the wisdom and effect of secrecy in international negotiations. This debate has become central to the process of foreign investment arbitration because parties to disputes nearly always can choose to hide arbitral outcomes from public view. Working with a new database of disputes at the world's largest investor-state arbitral institution, the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, the authors examine the incentives of firms and governments to keep the details of their disputes secret. The authors argue that secrecy in the context of investment arbitration works like a flexibility-enhancing device, similar to the way escape clauses function in the context of international trade. To attract and preserve investment, governments make contractual and treaty-based promises to submit to binding arbitration in the event of a dispute. They may prefer secrecy in cases when they are under strong political pressure to adopt policies that violate international legal norms designed to protect investor interests. Investors favor secrecy when managing politically sensitive disputes over assets they will continue to own and manage in host countries long after the particular dispute has passed. Although governments prefer secrecy to help facilitate politically difficult bargaining, secrecy diminishes one of the central purposes of arbitration: to allow governments to signal publicly their general commitment to investor-friendly policies. Understanding the incentives for keeping the details of dispute resolution secret may help future scholars explain more accurately the observed patterns of wins and losses from investor-state arbitration as well as patterns of investment.},

First, the empirical data confirm the existence of a far-reaching institutional transformation of IOs over the past sixty years, pervading all issue areas, policy func- tions, and world regions. Second, variation in TNA access within and across IOs is mainly explained by a combination of three factors: functional demand for the resources of TNAs, domestic democratic standards in the membership of IOs, and state concerns with national sovereignty. Third, existing research suffers from a selection bias that has led it to overestimate the general importance of a new participatory norm in global gov- ernance for the openness of IOs.},

abstract = {A prominent international-relations theory posits that mutual optimism, due to two sides holding divergent estimates of their relative bargaining power, causes interstate conflict. We develop a theory of mutual optimism in which conflicting bargaining power estimates arise from asymmetric information about which, if any, third parties will join either side in a military dispute. We contend that secret alliances can generate mutual optimism, which increases the probability of conflict. By exploiting secret alliances as a measurable source of private information, we provide the first systematic test of mutual optimism that directly assesses a state's secret capabilities. Optimism exists when a state's secret allies are more numerous or powerful than anticipated by opponents. Our empirical tests—as well as robustness checks—strongly support our theoretical expectation. We conclude that mutual optimism is an empirically, as well as theoretically, important cause of interstate conflict.},

Rather, each represents a position on a spectrum of commitment and is distinguished by the strength of the obligation it imposes. Once the various legal forms are recognized as different in degree rather than kind, other features of the system are easier to understand. The book discusses how the substantive content of an international agreement relates to its form, including whether the agreement provides for dispute resolution, monitoring, exit, escape, and reservations. With respect to customary international law, this book explains how and why such rules of law work, and how existing notions of custom must be adapted to accommodate the rational choice approach.},

Theoretical paradigm used to separate hard from soft-law - procedural criteria. If it was ratified it is Hard law, if it was not it is soft-law.

The theoretical framework Voigt used to assess the choice between hard and soft law was two-fold. (i) the individual decision-making is assessed under the light of institutional economics and transaction-cost economics; (ii) the strategic interaction is assessed through the lenses of game-theory.

Transaction cost analysis

(a) Relevant transaction costs in international lawmaking


(1) Negotiation costs - Cf {\textgreater} Ci
(2) Ratification costs - Cf {\textgreater} Ci
(3) Monitoring costs - Cf {\textless} Ci ( because formal cooperation allows for cost-sharing in the monitoring)
(4) Enforcement costs - Cf {\textless} Ci (idem; plus: the larger publicity allows for reputational and domestic enforcement to occur IMPORTANT!)
(5) Modification costs - Cf {\textgreater} Ci
(6) Exit costs - Cf {\textgreater} Ci

All things equal, rational lawmakers will prefer informal institutions if neither (i) monitoring, and (ii) enforcement problems exist

(b) governance structure-related costs

Now we turn to the relevant "governance structure costs", since, as seen before, hierarchical structures of governance (in our case Hard-law) may make sense if (i) TC are high and the (ii) governance "structure" costs are also low. Otherwise there may be no net benefits from curbing those TCs.

The determinants of "governance structure costs"

(1) frequency of interaction (function of geography, externalities etc.).

(2) Degree of asset specificity (Hold-up risk...)

(3) degree of uncertainty

Transaction cost-based conjectures:
(i) low frequency of interaction and asset specificity ought to lead to less formality; (ii) whereas high frequency and asset specific enforcement ought to lead to more formal law; (iii) finally, where there are high degrees of asset specificity, uncertainty will matter, and so one would expect increases in formality. 

Game theoretical analysis

Conjectures:

H1) IIL ought to be expected more often in coordination games, whereas FIL in mixed-motive games

H2) Repeat pplayers are more likely to resort to IIL (potential for tit for tat...)

H3) Given the lack of publicness it is unlikely to govern situations where the underlying pay-off structure is that of a prisoners dilemma

H4) States will prefer FIL if they are interested in improving their reputation (alternative: high reputation, all things equal, more IIL)

H5) Due to increasing monitoring costs, IIL is likely to be agreed upon among small numbers of participants

H6) Politicians will prefer informal over more formal law if the agreement will be unpopular among its constituents (ISSUE SALIENCE!!!). The rationale being the lower the issue-salience the lower thedomestic audience costs + lower expected losses in terms of rent-seeking.

H7) Incumbetn will prefer FIL if it expectes loosing the elections. Rationale: tying hands mechanism (see e.g. Moravcsik 2000).

A weekness pointed out by professor voigt is that the decision on the institutional-choice must always be incentive compatible with all parties. He thus proposes that future work should give more attention to bargaining theory. [A potentially relevant variable may be power...in coordination games the powerfull parties are expected to be able to set the agenda...ver melhor).

Data

There is no world-wide available data on the collection of such agreements and, furthermore, many countries do not even keep track of them.. To curb this they focused on informal agreements concluded by the US. Due to the "Case-Zablocki act of 1917", which prescribes the department of states reporting all IAs to congress no later than 60 days after entering into force. (N= 2,289). Exempted were: (i) militery-related agreements; (ii) classified material; (iii) irrelevant coordination games; (iv) bilateral assistance for narcotics and relatively similar criminal behaviour.

Domestic politics conjectures

States deal with informal international law in different ways. In germany the ministry in charge of the cooperative effort shoudl always "before international law treaties are elaborated and concluded, the ministry in charge must check whether a binding contract under international law is irrefutable or whether the same goal may also be attained through other means, specially through understandings which are below the threshold of an international agreement". In France, however, these agreements ought to be exception and only resorted to in particularly uncertain circumstances. What explains these variations?

H1) The higher the number of players that need to consent to ratify formal international law domestically, the higher the proportion of informal law. [this argument applies to hard v. soft but not necessarily to public v. secret).

H2) The higher the required majorities needed to ratify FIL, the higher the proportion of informal law.

H3) The higher the degree of ideological heterogeneity among the veto players, the higher the proportion of informal law.

H4) The more costly it is to abolish formal treaty law (in terms of the number of players who have to consent and/or the required majorities), the higher the proportion of informal law.

H5) Countries in which formal international law assumes supremacy over domestic law will pass relatively less formal international law than countries in which the inverse holds, ceteris paribus.

H6) If the domestic judiciary has the power to apply formal international law directly, a higher proportion of informal law will be used than in countries in which the direct application is not possible.

H7) presidential systems will resort more often to informal law than will parliamentary systems. ( Rationale: the executive passes a great deal of informal law, i.e. “legislates” without the legislature's approval and sometimes without the legislature even being informed of it (either before international agreements are concluded or even after), the legislature may have an incentive to change this state of affairs).

H8) legislatures under presidential systems are more likely to pass legislation aimed at monitoring informal law making than are legislatures under parliamentary systems.

H9) Governments under MR systems are more likely than governments under PR systems to draw on informal law because agreements are less visible

H10) ((a) The longer a country has been sovereign, the higher the propensity of its government to resort to informal law.
(b) The longer a country has been democratic without interruption, the higher the propensity of its government to resort to informal law.

Particularly relevant for Part I of the thesis!!!! See page 11!!

Voigt seems to recognize the potential for the "retaliatory-disclosure" mechanism to induce compliance. Because part of the benefits of doing an informal agreement stemm from its secrecy and unorbservability, then given the value of secrecy it may be used to deter defection. In the absence of a central enforcement authority contrats tended to be enforced by the exchange of collateral or hostages (Kronman 1985). Voigt mentions that because the instrument if disclosed leads to high costs then it may be seen as an "hostage". If one of the parties decides to defect, the other may threaten to "destroy the hostage". The problem with the "hostage exchange metaphor" is that it is not clear why such a threat would be credible. After all, the other party also engaged in it and would also thus suffer reputational costs too.

Results

(1) Informal international law making did increase dramatically until around 2006. Since then, its use has declined almost as dramatically. (2) Around two-thirds of all international agreements are concerned with only three policy areas: the military, science and technology, and aid. (3) More than 90{\%} of all international agreements are conducted bilaterally. (4) More than 40 percent of all agreements are concluded by a non-traditional actor on the U.S. side, i.e., an actor other than the president or the secretary of state.

Future agenda for research

(1) what are the central characteristics of these agreements that could be described in more detail? Design of renegotiation rules, sunset clauses, enforcement mechanisms...

(2) Are these agreements equally as likely to be complied with as FIL or are there systematic differences?

(3) Cross-country analysis of two main questions: (i) the same hypothesis accross coutry? (ii) variations in the institutional set-up for monitoring IIL

(4) Model bargain dynamics in the institutional-choice? [variation on the valuation for secrecy and cooeperative benefits!!! + Power asymmetries!!!]

(5) determinants of IILawmaking by IOs},

annote = {1) Why it matters

TNA participation in IOs varies accross time and IOs. This article attempts to understand this phenomena by theoretically analyzing transparency as institutional-design. The theoretical conjectures will then be tested through  a dataset of formal TNA access in 298 organizational bodies from fifty IOs.

Centran results: (i) TNA participation in IOs increased over the past sixty years in all IOs and across issue area; (ii) variation in TNA access seems to be driven by a combination of three factors:  functional demand for resources of TNAs, domestic democratic standards, and state concerns with national sovereignity; (iii) existing research suffers from a slection bias that has led it to overestimate the general importance of a new participatory norm in global governance for the openness of IOs.

By contrast, they find only limited support for constructivist arguments which suggest that a norm of openness has emerged and has been internalized by the states.


Summary

Main research questions: (i) why would states engage in the high sovereignity costs of allowing TNAs to participate in international decision-making? (ii) what explains the dramatic increase in TNA participation in the last years? (iii) what accounts for the variations in IO-access by TNAs?

The theoretical starting point is that they conceive TNA access as a dimension of the institutional design of IOs. Access is different from participation, where the latter, for them, means only presence, and the former means participation in policy-making and its implementation. Importante: It should be noted, however, that in our theoretical framework of transparency as access to compliance-relevant information, mere presence may matter; if by just being there the TNAs obtain access to such information they may diffuse it thus potentially raising reputational and dometic audience costs.

The dataset

The selected IOs (50) make a stratified random sample. The sample was drawn from the Correlates of war IGO dataset. To be included in the sample the IOs must: (i) be intergovernamental; (ii) be budgetary, decision-making, and reporting, indepent from other IOs; (iii) have at least three members; (iv)  have at leaston organizational body that operates permanently; (v) and be active in 2010 (???).
The stratification is used to ensure that the sample represents IOs across issue area. The population of 182 IOs were categorized by 10 issue areas - (i) Multi-issue, (ii) Commodities, (iii) Social Affairs, (iv) Development, (v) environment, (vi) Finance, (vii) Human Rights, (viii) Security, (ix) technology, (x) trad, See Sommerer and Tallber 2016 - and five world regions.

The unit of analysis is IO bodies, such as ministerial councils, committees, and secretariats.

MUITO IMPORTANTE: The dataset exclusively captures formal access to IO bodies, as laid down in treaty provisions, rules of procedure, ministerial decisions, policy guidelines, or equivalent (see sommerer and Tallberg 2016). The data has been collected on the basis of documents from archives, databases, and direct data requests to the relevant IOs. The dataset does not capture informal access to IO bodies developed through customs and practices.


They measure TNA access with a composite index that contains 4 dimensions of access. First, the depth of access captures the level of involvement offered to TNAs through institutional rules, and covers a continum from active and direct involvement (equal to states) to passive and indirect involvment, such as observing negotiations.
Second, the range of access captures the breadth of TNAs entitled to particiate, and includes a spectrum from all interested TNAs to only those that fulfill a very restrictive set of selection criteria (see page 745!!).
Third, the permanence of access captures the extent to which institutional rules grant a permanent right for TNAs to be involved, or whether such privileges are ad hoc or by invitation.
Finally, the codification of access captures how access is legally regulated, and thus its revocability by distinguishing between regulation through treaties, secondary legislation, or bureaucratic decisions (scores ranging between through treaty provision, to secondary legislation and bureaucratic decisions).

Composite index: Access = 1/n * [sum of all] (range + depth) * Permanence * Codification

Where the permanence and codification variables are multiplied against range and depth as weights on the access. I.e. high scores in range and depth have relatively lower scores where participation is ad hoc and granted by non-binding sources (because it is unstable).

Theories and Hypothesis

a) Constructivist hypothesis, or the "conventional wisdom"

The basic premise of the theory is that institutions will reflect the ideas and norms about what "constitutes appropriate and legitimate modes of governance". Instead of focusing in efficiency, states will design institutions according to the internalized idea of legitimate design or because they think its the " socially expectable" design.
Now focusing in TNA participation, the constructivist theories can be grouped in two: (i) in the first version, MS and IO bureaucrats expanded third-party participation because they have been socialized to believe that it is "the right thing to do"; (ii) in the second version, they favour more external participation not because they have internalized this norms, but to increase legitimacy which is a necessary condition for them to achieve their governance objectives and induce compliace (Hurd 1999 - procurar!! [foi o argumento que AVA usou!! MUITO IMPORTANTE]).


H1: We expect IO bodies to open upas the participatory norm grows stronger and spreads, regardless of whetherIO policy-makers have internalized or adapted defensively to it


H2: We expect TNA access to be particularly high for IO bodies in policy areas and regions where the UN has engaged in participatory governance, reflecting its role as norm entrepreneur.


H3: We expect TNA access to be especially high for IO bodies that have been challenged by civil society actors, are at risk of being challenged, or are higly politicized.


b) Their argument: functional demand, domestic democracy, and state sovereignity

The rational functionalist explanatory dimension focuses on the demand for TNA participation due to the expected benefits it may provide. In particular, it argues that the IO bodies will resort to TNAs where they lack the resources or expertise needed for a certain relevant task. The advantages of TNAs ought to be more pronounced in policy areas which are (i) technically complex, require local implementation, and present significant non-compliance incentives, and where compliance information is held by societal actors (or at least in a more cost-effective manner). The rationale being that TNA are generally experts on the policy issues that most concern them (and the information they provided is for free) which will be particularly relevant in areas with technical complexity or uncertainty about the state of the world, are better positioned to implement policy at the societal level, and have unique access to grassroots information on state violations.

H4: we expect higher TNA participation access for IO bodies engaged in governance tasks that are technically complex, require local programmatic activities, and present significative non compliance incentives


The second dimension is based on the recent literature linking domestic political institutions with international preferences. The nature of the regime is expected to shape state preferences where they tap into features of domestic relevance. Democratic countries have already in place many transparency inducing institutions, and so the relative costs of allowing TNA participation are lower; whereas in autocracies, it may provide a path for domestic oppositions to by-pass the control of the regime. [yet, the sovereignity costs should be relatively higher for democracies, where actual institutions which constrain political action exist, than in autocracies...however the author focus more in the marginal impact of these practices].

H5: we expect higher TNA access for IO bodies in organizations with more democratic memberships


The third explanatory dimension focuses on relative sovereignity costs which will depend in the salience of the policy area. The authors assume that (i) these costs should be higher in the decision-making, monitoring and implementation areas; (ii) and in areas of westphalian sovereignty.

H6: We expect lower TNA access for IO bodies involved in policy function and issue areas associated with high sovereignty costs


Empirical analysis (i) - emp. strategy [MUITO IMPORTANTE]

They assessed the effects of a growing participatory norm (h1) based on the variable "participatory discourse". Using Google Ngram, google books database for searching for number of appearences of specific terms in publications, They used as key words: (i) "democratic deficit", "participatory governance", and "global governance". To avoid endogeneity problems they turned "participatory discourse" into a lagged variable. Based on the literature in norm internalization, they used three-year lag.

To assess the role of the UN as a norm entrepreneur they created a variable that measures whether the UN held a special conference in the same issue area or region as an IO body weighted by the number of TNA representatives.

To assess h3 they use the indicator "protests against IO" (Beyeler and Kriesi 2005) which captures media coverages of protests against IOs. The data for this indicator were generated from the lexis-nexis academic database including 6,270 articles from eighty daily newspapers in the category "world major newspaper" from 1960 to 2010, and by using keywords "demonstrator" and "protestor", combined with the name of the organization. They apply a three year DECREASING lag starting from the moment of the protest, and logarithmize the scale to limite the effect of outliers. They focus on the number of references by the New York Times and Le monde.

For H4 they coded three variables: (i) technical complexity; (ii) local activities; (iii) non-compliance incentives. The coding was based on the description of their tasks in official documents and self-presentations. For each they then created a three-step scale composed by "not relevant", "somewhat relevant", to "highly relevant".

For h5 they measure the average level of democracy in each IOs membership based on polity IV scores. They add an 1-year lag to avoid reverse causality.

For h6 they use two dummies: (i) one for whether the body is a decision-makign body, and (ii) whether or not it works on security matters.

They control for: (i) budget (data from reports or the yearbook of international organizations); (ii) preference heterogeneity (UN General Assembly votes from the Affinity of Nations Index); (iii) Power asymmetries (democratic major power asymmetries); (iv) TNA Supply (time-series on broad set of NGOs accredited to the UN  ECOSOC).

They test their hypothesis using Tobit regression analysis. The choice is due to: (i) the fact that they are as interested in the degree if openness as well as the likelihood of that occuring. The continuous component, or all values greater than zero, represents the degree of TNA access for the ...pp 761.

" Whether democratic citizens should have access to the treaty-making process was important in 1918. Today, it is more significant. In 1918, those requesting access were journalists. Today, hundreds of organizations with vested interests are implicated. Transparency is normatively connected to our notion of democracy; moreover, recent positive analyses show that transparency gives democracies an advantage in crisis negotiations. I elaborate conditions under which secret international negotiations can enhance social welfare in democracies. Specifically, I find that secrecy can 1) result in outcomes that are less likely to be sabotaged, 2) result in less socially inefficient use of resources by interest groups, and 3) shorten the bargaining process. I illustrate my arguments with examples from recent history.},

Voting in the Convention was by majority vote, each state having one vote. ... The voting procedure at the Convention, however, increased their bargaining power for logrolling purposes. ... In defending the absolute veto for the King, Mirabeau argued that the assembly could always overrule the veto by the threat of refusing to vote in favor of taxes. ... To see this, we may note that the interests of constituencies may affect a delegate in two ways. ... The members of the constituent assembly were suspended, as I said, between the King's troops and the Parisian crowd. ... Mirabeau's replies to the King's challenge were, however, subject to the threatwarning ambiguity. ... Although two of the New York delegates left because they thought the Convention was exceeding its mandate, they never used the threat to leave as a bargaining ploy. ... Next, I discussed overt self-interest at work in threat-based bargaining. ... Let me begin with the most basic question: why argue at all? Why not simply adopt a bargaining stance, or demand an immediate vote without prior debate? I can think of four answers, but there may be others. .},

abstract = {Why do countries comply with international agreements? While scholars have done rigorous work to address compliance and enforcement in an international game, less analytical attention has been paid to domestic mechanisms of compliance. However, because international agreements have domestic distributional consequences, there exist domestic sources of enforcement. In this article, I develop an analytical framework of domestic accountability, where I identify specific channels of influence through which domestic constituencies can influence national compliance. Using a game theoretic model, I show that a government's compliance decision reflects the electoral leverage and the informational status of domestic constituencies. This framework further provides a theoretical rationale for why and how international institutions may influence states' compliance through domestic mechanisms. The European acid rain regime offers an empirical illustration of the domestic constituency argument.},

abstract = {Second edition. This book offers a concise yet comprehensive review of the principles of EU external relations law. By carefully examining the role of the Union on the global scene, it provides a systematic overview of the relevant rules and competences, reflecting on the legal developments in their political and societal context. In addition to up-to-date analyses of, inter alia, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Common Security and Defence Policy and the Common Commercial Policy, it highlights the EU's external powers with regard to the environment, fundamental rights and development cooperation. Moreover, it includes dedicated chapters exploring the relations with neighbouring countries, and explaining the complex interplay between rules of domestic, European and international provenance. The second edition of this established text (the first edition was published under the title Layered Global Player in 2011) has been geared even more specifically towards students, for example through the inclusion of chapter overviews, clarifying boxes, and supplementary examples, while a meticulous review of the narrative has further enhanced its accessibility. As before, the book's compact dimensions, transparent structure and engaging style of writing enable readers to master the main features of this gripping field of law with ease. It thus remains an invaluable resource for students and lecturers alike. Introducing a layered global player -- Part I : Legal dynamics of the outer layer -- The common foreign and security policy -- The common security and defence policy -- Part II : Legal dynamics of the middle layers -- The common commercial policy -- The external environmental policy -- The external human rights policy -- The development cooperation and humanitarian aid policy -- Part III : Legal dynamics of the inner layer -- Special relationships in the European neighbourhood and beyond -- The EU, the member states and international law -- Conclusion : an effective global player? -- Case law registry.},

abstract = {Informal agreements are the most common form of international cooperation and the least studied. Ranging from simple oral deals to detailed executive agreements, they permit states to conclude profitable bargains without the formality of treaties. They differ from treaties in more than just a procedural sense. Treaties are designed, by long-standing convention, to raise the credibility of promises by staking national reputation on their adherence. Informal agreements have a more ambiguous status and are useful for precisely that reason. They are chosen to avoid formal and visible national pledges, to avoid the political obstacles of ratification, to reach agreements quickly and quietly, and to provide flexibility for subsequent modification or even renunciation. They differ from formal agreements not because their substance is less important (the Cuban missile crisis was solved by informal agreement) but because the underlying promises are less visible and more equivocal. The prevalence of such informal devices thus reveals not only the possibilities of international cooperation but also the practical obstacles and the institutional limits to endogenous enforcement.},

Today there are more than two dozen that have collectively issued over thirty-seven thousand binding legal rulings.The New Terrain of International Lawcharts the developments and trends in the creation and role of international courts, and explains how the delegation of authority to international judicial institutions influences global and domestic politics. The New Terrain of International Lawpresents an in-depth look at the scope and powers of international courts operating around the world. Focusing on dispute resolution, enforcement, administrative review, and constitutional review, Karen Alter argues that international courts alter politics by providing legal, symbolic, and leverage resources that shift the political balance in favor of domestic and international actors who prefer policies more consistent with international law objectives. International courts name violations of the law and perhaps specify remedies. Alter explains how this limited power--the power to speak the law--translates into political influence, and she considers eighteen case studies, showing how international courts change state behavior. The case studies, spanning issue areas and regions of the world, collectively elucidate the political factors that often intervene to limit whether or not international courts are invoked and whether international judges dare to demand significant changes in state practices.},

Such data are widely used in epidemiology; in this article I claim that they are also well suited to applications in political economy. Web searches provide a unique proxy for a fundamental political activity that we otherwise have little sense of: information seeking. Information seeking by constituents can be usefully examined as an instance of political mobilization. Applying web-search data to international trade disputes, I provide evidence for the belief that US citizens are concerned about their country being branded a violator of international law, even when they have no direct material stake in the case at hand.

From the study of war and peace, to exploring economic cooperation and environmental conflict, furthering a methodologically-guided understanding of international politics requires a systematic approach to identifying fundamental processes and forces of change. With the growing importance of economic interdependence and the profound changes in the international system during the last few decades, the analysis of International Relations has expanded in three main directions. First, scholars have ventured into new issue areas of International Relations including international environmental politics, international ethics, and globalization. Second, new methods have emerged within the study of International Relations (e.g., two-level game analysis and spatial analysis), and the scope of methodologies has substantially broadened over the past decades to include greater use of rational choice analysis and statistical methods. Finally, aiming at a more precise understanding of complex interactions among players at the international level, students of the field have developed greater specialization within both substantive sub-fields and methodological approaches. These developments have undoubtedly enriched International Relations research and have drawn more attention to additional areas of study such as compliance with international treaties and the explanation of civil wars.

abstract = {This article introduces a new data set on the access of transnational actors (TNAs) to international organizations (IOs). While IOs were long the exclusive preserve of member governments, recent decades have witnessed a shift toward more inclusive forms of governance, involving participation by non-governmental organizations, philanthropic founda-tions, multinational corporations, and other forms of TNAs. Yet existing research has lacked the data necessary to map this phenomenon and its variation over dimensions such as time, issue areas, and world regions. The TRANSACCESS data set is designed for this purpose and contains information on the level of openness in 298 bodies of 50 IOs from 1950 to 2010. On the basis of this data set, we also introduce a first quantita-tive measure of institutional openness in the shape of a composite index, available at both the IO and body levels. This index can be used to com-pare TNA access across and within IOs but also as a variable in large-N studies on global and regional governance, where IO openness is poten-tially relevant. One of the most profound changes in the organization of international coopera-tion in recent decades is the growing involvement of transnational actors (TNAs), such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), philanthropic foundations, sci-entific communities, and multinational corporations. Today, it is widespread prac-tice that international organizations (IOs), through treaties, statutes, and decisions, enable TNAs to participate in policymaking, for instance, by providing services, submitting policy papers, and lodging legal complaints. Numerous case studies have documented these changing opportunities for TNAs to take part in the activities of IOs. Yet existing research has lacked the data necessary to provide an overview of this phenomenon and its variation over dimensions such as time, issue areas, and world regions. Instead, the concentration of case studies devoted to large global IOs—the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Trade Organization (WTO)—has led to a suspicion that our existing understanding of IO openness may be biased. In this article, we introduce a new large-N data set on the formal access of TNAs to IOs and their bodies, TRANSACCESS. While recent publications from this project have addressed the determinants of TNA access to IOs (Tallberg et al. 2013, 2014; Tallberg, Sommerer, and Squatrito 2015), this research note describes the TRANSACCESS data set in its full extent and explains the multiple ways in 1},

abstract = {In 2013, EU and USA initiated a new political dialogue regarding a further deepening of bilateral trade and investment relations, the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership). In some EU member countries, anti-TTIP street protests and political activists received substantial support. The paper is concerned with the drivers of public support or disapproval of TTIP. In particular, we focus on the role of (dis-)trust in companies and in political institutions for attitude formation concerning economic regulation. We use data from a Eurobarometer Survey conducted in November 2014 to assess the determinants of individual approval or disapproval of TTIP by European citizens. By means of a mixed-level logit regression it can be shown that disapproval is highly correlated with a lack of trust in European institutions and in large companies. Our results moreover indicate that anti-TTIP political activism has a strong impact on TTIP-related preferences.},

abstract = {Why do countries comply with international agreements? While scholars have done rigorous work to address compliance and enforcement in an international game, less analytical attention has been paid to domestic mechanisms of compliance. However, because international agreements have domestic distributional consequences, there exist domestic sources of enforcement. In this article, I develop an analytical framework of domestic accountability, where I identify specific channels of influence through which domestic constituencies can influence national compliance. Using a game theoretic model, I show that a government's compliance decision reflects the electoral leverage and the informational status of domestic constituencies. This framework further provides a theoretical rationale for why and how international institutions may influence states' compliance through domestic mechanisms. The European acid rain regime offers an empirical illustration of the domestic constituency argument.},

abstract = {We examine why international actors-including states, firms, and activists-seek different types of legalized arrangements to solve political and substantive problems. We show how particular forms of legalization provide superior institutional solutions in different circumstances. We begin by examining the baseline advantages of "hard" legalization (that is, precise, legally binding obligations with appropriate third-party delegation). We emphasize, however, that actors often prefer softer forms of legalization (that is, various combinations of reduced precision, less stringent obligation, and weaker delegation). Soft legalization has a number of significant advantages, including that it is easier to achieve, provides strategies for dealing with uncertainty, infringes less on sovereignty, and facilitates compromise among differentiated actors. Although our approach is largely interest-based, we explicitly incorporate the normative elements that are central in law and in recent international relations theorizing. We also consider the important role of nonstate actors who, along with states, are central participants in contemporary international legalization. We illustrate the advantages of various forms of international legal arrangements with examples drawn from articles in this special issue and elsewhere.},

This article analyzes the relationship between global naming and shaming efforts and governments' human rights practices for 145 countries from 1975 to 2000. The statistics show that governments put in the spotlight for abuses continue or even ramp up some violations afterward, while reducing others. One reason is that governments' capacities for human rights improvements vary across types of violations. Another is that governments are strategically using some violations to offset other improvements they make in response to international pressure to stop violations.},

@article{Ehring2008,
abstract = {In 2005, the first dispute settlement panels of the World Trade Organization (WTO) decided that the public could observe their oral hearings. Following three years of panel practice with open hearings where both parties requested public access, the Appellate Body in 2008 followed suit and held its first open hearings. Most people had believed this to be impossible without modification of the WTO Agreement, and WTO Members were far apart regarding the desirability and legality of open hearings. This controversy persists, but it has changed considerably, based on the entirely successful experience of open hearings to date, which has already prompted several WTO Members to change their position. The new practice is a historic and irreversible shift from sixty years of Practice under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and in the WTO. It is also remarkable given the importance of allowing public observation of judicial hearings, as it exists across the world both domestically and internationally. More than a quarter of WTO disputes currently have public hearings, and the future practice is likely to consolidate the trend. No political fallout has occurred so far, as it did on amicus curiae in 2000. This is also unlikely to happen in the future, which will tell whether WTO Members can find agreement on codifying rules on transparency. Already now, justice is not only done at the WTO, but it can also be seen to be done.},

In assessing the model we employ data from all Eurobarometer surveys conducted in the 24-year period between 1971 and 1994 together with policy data from the Official Journal of the EC/EU. Our findings suggest that public preferences regarding European unification do reflect policy, though only as the salience of the domain has increased over time.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

By mapping strategic environments onto monitoring arrangements, it accounts for who detects noncompliance and who brings it to light.

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Scholars and practitioners alike have stressed the important role of trans-parency in promoting international regime compliance and effectiveness. Yet many regimes fail to create high levels of transparency: governments and nongovernmental actors regularly fail to monitor or report on their own behavior, the behavior of other actors, or the state of the problem these regimes seek to resolve. If more transparency often, if not always, contributes to regime effectiveness, then identifying the sources of trans-parency becomes an important research task. Regime transparency de-pends upon both the demand for information and the supply of information. Specifically, regimes can seek "effectiveness-oriented" infor-mation to assess whether regime members are collectively achieving re-gime goals or "compliance-oriented" information to assess whether particular actors are individually fulfilling regime commitments. The incentives and capacities that relevant actors-whether governments, nongovernmental organizations, or corporate actors-have to provide such information depend on whether the regime's information system is structured around self-reporting, other-reporting, or problem-reporting. Although many of these factors are determined by characteristics of the actors involved or the structure of the problem, regimes can increase transparency by enhancing the incentives and capacity actors have to contribute to a particular regime's transparency. Transparency is crucial to the effectiveness of international regimes. Indeed, promoting transparency-fostering the acquisition, analysis, and dissemination of regular, prompt, and accurate regime-relevant information-is often one of the most important functions regimes perform. In many regimes, such information underpins efforts to alter state behavior and allows regime members to evaluate past progress in order to redesign the regime to perform better in the future. Yet, for all its nominal importance to regime success, many regimes fail to induce adequate transparency. Both anecdotal incidents-from Iraqi nuclear programs to years of clandestine Soviet whaling-and more systematic evaluations remind us that gov-ernments regularly fail to provide the timely and accurate reports mandated by most security, human rights, and environmental treaties.

@article{Hurd1999,
abstract = {The idea that the legitimacy of international institutions affects state behavior is increasingly common in discussions of international relations, and yet little has been said about what the term legitimacy means or how it works. This is peculiar, since legitimacy is widely cited in domestic social studies as a major reason, along with coercion and self-interest, that actors obey rules. I examine the concept of legitimacy, defined as the internalization of an external rule, as it is used in domestic studies and in international relations, and find that the existence of institutions that states accept as legitimate has important implications for theories of international relations. Using the norms of sovereign nonintervention as an illustration, I compare coercion, self-interest, and legitimacy as three motivations for rule-following by states. Self-interest and coercion, alone or together, are insufficient to sustain the pattern of behavior we recognize as the system of sovereign states. The degree of settledness of borders, especially among states of unequal power, indicates that the institution of sovereignty owes part of its persistence to the widespread acceptance by states of the norms of sovereignty as legitimate. This is important for international relations because the existence of legitimate rules signals the presence of authority, which is inconsistent with the received image of the international system as anarchic. I conclude the article by charting a course of further research into the ideas of legitimacy, authority, and anarchy.},

@incollection{Maupin2013,
abstract = {How transparent is the international investment law regime, and how transparent should it be? Most studies approach these questions from one of two competing premises. One camp maintains that the existing regime is opaque and should be made completely transparent; the other finds the regime sufficiently transparent and worries that any further transparency reforms would undermine the regime's essential functioning. This paper explores the tenability of these two positions by plumbing the precise contours of transparency as an overarching norm within international investment law. After defining transparency in a manner befitting the decentralized nature of the regime, the paper identifies international investment law's key transparent, semi-transparent, and non-transparent features. It underscores that these categories do not necessarily map onto prevailing normative judgments concerning what might constitute good, bad, and murky transparency practices. The paper then moves beyond previous analyses by suggesting five strategic considerations that should factor into future assessments of whether and how particular aspects of the regime should be rendered more transparent. It concludes with a tentative assessment of the penetration, recent evolution, and likely trajectory of transparency principles within the contemporary international investment law regime.},

This in turn offers a concrete application of the sociological argument that EU institutions not only matter, but shows how, by building legitimation and appropriateness standards into the negotiation process, institutional environments can place limits on instrumentalism.},

abstract = {Why do sets of sovereign governments create judicial institutions and grant these institutions the power to rule their actions invalid? Once such a court is created, under what conditions is that court able to rule against these governments and get compliance with their rulings? Finally, how might the influence of the court change over time? This study presents a general theory of judicial institutions that provides a unified answer to these three questions. I argue that governments create judicial institutions to help solve collective action problems endemic to operating under a common regulatory regime. Once established, a court in its institutional “infancy” is capable of facilitating compliance with that regulatory regime's rules but only consistent with the purpose for which the governments created the court. And finally, once the court has earned the trust of a government's public, its ability to enforce the regulatory regime's rules qualitatively expands. In demonstrating this last point, I derive how and why publics can rationally come to believe that supporting a court, if there was a conflict between its government and the court, would be in that public's interest.},

@article{Johns2016,
abstract = {International organizations (IOs) play a vital role in enforcing international law. Many treaties are built on transnational enforcement, in which private actors challenge and litigate possible legal violations. Others feature international enforcement, in which only states can challenge possible violations. Some feature centralized enforcement, in which an IO has its own authority to challenge possible violations. I argue that collective action problems drive decisions about whether to enforce international law, and hence affect the optimal design of enforcement regimes. When cooperation generates concentrated benefits—such as compensation for the expropriation of foreign investment—transnational enforcement can work well because the cost and benefit of enforcement are both fully internalized by the litigant. However, when cooperation generates diffuse benefits—like a cleaner environment—individuals and even governments have incentive to free-ride on enforcement, avoiding the cost of litigation in the hopes that another actor will step up. In such circumstances, supranational enforcement is necessary to uphold international law. Finally, hybrid regimes, which contain multiple forms of enforcement, are most needed when an IO has members that vary in their ability to enforce, or regulates issue areas that vary in their diffuseness. I assess my argument by examining litigation in the European Court of Justice, and provide evidence that the European Union is more likely to enforce EU laws that generate diffuse benefits, while private actors and governments are more likely to enforce EU laws that generate concentrated benefits.},

The analysis builds on original survey data of more than 400 NGOs involved in five different IOs, complemented by elite interviews with IO and state officials. Secondly, the article advances a specific argument about how the strategic exchange of information and access between NGOs and IOs increases NGO influence in IOs. This argument, derived from theories of lobbying in American and European politics, is contrasted with three alternative explanations of NGO influence, privileging material resources, transnational networks and public opinion mobilization, and the broader implications of these results for research on NGOs in global governance are explored.},

In every period in history when war was a threat or in progress, or when a ruler of one state coveted land belonging to another sovereign state, treaties and secret treaties were negotiated, concluded, signed, ratified, and implemented—and often breached. From the earliest identified secret treaty in 499 between Godegisile, one of the kings of Bourgogne, and Clovis, King of the Francs, through the Classified Religious Freedom Agreement between the United States and Vietnam in 2005, Professor Edward Grosek has compiled this exceptional reference work detailing nearly 1,000 secret treaties and agreements spanning more than 1,500 years. For the very first time, treaty researchers now have a one-stop resource to begin or enhance their own research into these clandestine relationships that were often created to deceive or topple the government or leaders of another nation. These " behind-the-scenes " acts reveal hidden intentions that oftentimes contradicted the world's view of one nation's feelings towards another.

Theoretically, Koremenos develops hypotheses regarding how cooperation problems like incentives to cheat can be confronted and moderated through law's detailed design provisions. Empirically, she exploits her data set composed of a random sample of international agreements in economics, the environment, human rights and security. Her theory and testing lead to a consequential discovery: considering the vagaries of international politics, international cooperation looks more law-like than anarchical, with the detailed provisions of international law chosen in ways that increase the prospects and robustness of cooperation. This nuanced and sophisticated 'continent of international law' can speak to scholars in any discipline where institutions, and thus institutional design, matter.},

The logical place to begin any systematic study of organizations is with their purpose. But there are all types and shapes and sizes of organizations even of economic organizations, and there is then some question whether there is any single purpose that would be characteristic of organizations generally. Organizations often perish if they do nothing to further the interests of their members, and this factor in must severely limit the number of organizations that fail to serve their members. Labor unions are expected to strive for higher wages and better working conditions for their members, farm organizations are expected to strive for favorable legislation for their members, cartels are expected to strive for higher prices for participating firms, and the state is expected to further the comm on interests of its citizens though in this nationalistic age the state often has interests and ambitions part from those of its citizens.},

A volume of secret treaties was published in England in 1917 and in the United States in early 1918,2 and the consequent reaction of public opinion greatly influenced the current statements of the aims of the belligerents.3 In his address of January 8, 1918, President Wilson put the subject of secret diplomacy at the forefront in the "program of the world's peace" embodied in the Fourteen Points: "Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no private international understandings of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always openly and in the public view."4 It has since developed that these words may have been written without a knowl-edge of the contents of the secret treaties made by Allied Powers during the war;5 but they were largely responsible for the crystallization of the revulsion which followed the publication of the secret treaties into a deter-mination that the end of the war should signalize the beginning of a new era in the conduct of international relations.

abstract = {We develop and test a general argument about the conditions under which state leaders are most likely to choose legal dispute resolution over bilateral negotiations as a means to settle international disputes. Our central claim is that leaders who anticipate significant domestic audience costs for the making of voluntary, negotiated concessions are likely to seek the "political cover" of an international legal ruling. In such cases, it will be easier for leaders to justify the making of concessions if they are mandated as part of a ruling by an international court or arbitration body. We test a series of domestic-level hypotheses using a dataset comprised of nearly 1,500 rounds of talks concerning disputed territorial claims. Our multivariate analyses indicate that state leaders opt for legal dispute resolution when they are highly accountable to domestic political opposition, as well as when the dispute is highly salient to domestic audiences.

Unfortunately, beyond some suggestive case studies and a few indirect statistical tests, there exists no direct and systematic evidence to support either claim. To empirically identify the effect of issue linkage, one must overcome five difficulties: properly evaluating multilateral processes, identifying issue linkage, identifying failed negotiations, identifying enforcement problems, and accounting for missing linkage data. I address these limitations through a variety of new approaches, most notably a new unit of analysis (the k-ad) for analyzing multilateral events, new data on failed military alliance negotiations, and using “buffer states” to test the credibility of alliance commitments.

abstract = {Allgemein zu hard law vs. soft law - 421 bis 423 zu referenzieren; dort auch teilweise zu den Vor- und Nachteilen von hard und soft law},
annote = {Why it matters? 
The international system, and its relations, is extremely legalized. However, one finds heterogeneous levels of “legalization” varying across regimes. This paper represents one of the first attempts at theorizing the “why” that is so. 
Research questions? 
  
{\textperiodcentered}         What explains institutional-choice, hard v. soft, in international legalization? 
  
Main takeaway? 
  
a)      What is the hard- v. soft-law continuum? 
In traditional legal terms hard-law refers to legally binding instruments of international law, treaties, and soft-law to non-binding agreements, such as informal agreements, (most) exchanges of letters etc. However, the authors of this article do not follow these procedural binary criteria, focusing in functional variables. 
The term hard law stands for (i) legally binding obligations that are (ii) precise and that (iii) delegate authority for interpreting and implementing the law; and soft law should stand for the opposite. Yet, contrary to the preceding literature, their continuum is not binary but rather composed by the three above continuous variables. And so the instruments are not just hard or soft, but can be one of the many values in the spectrum. 
To characterize these continuum they resort to three variables: (i) “O” referring to the level of obligation, (ii) “P” precision of the provisions; and (iii) “D” degree of delegation. Varia- tions along each dimension are indicated by capital letters for high levels (for example, O), small letters for moderate levels (for example, o), and dashes for low levels (-). Thus, [O,P,D] or [O,p,D] constitute hard law, and [-,-,-] will be on the opposite of spectrum, in between one may find [o,P,-] for example, meaning moderate obligation, high precision and low delegation. 
b)      Endogeneizing institutional-choice 
Advantages of Hard-law 
1.      Credible commitments 
Given the “anarchical” structure of the international system, states have a hard-time decoupling true-revealed preferences from cheap-talk which leads to (ex ante) transaction-cost enhancing uncertainty regarding preferences. Similarly, states cannot observe the behaviour of others which leads to uncertainty regarding behaviour. If these uncertainty-based transaction costs are high enough they may trump the expected benefits of cooperation and lead to non-cooperative behaviour. The expected transaction costs of uncertainty are relatively low when the underlying game is of pure coordination but increase as the game attains a mixed-motive structure (chicken, assurance, prisoners dilemma etc.). 
Hard-law instruments, [O,P,D] or [O,p,D], can help curbing these problems since they have ex-ante “screening” and “ex post” constraining. First, hard law instruments entail more sunk-costs stemming from negotiation costs, ratification costs etc., which reduce the expected benefits of defection thus adding cost to the signalling – i.e. to the credibility of the IA. Secondly, because these agreements tend to lead to the production of information regarding commitment and behaviour, the expected costs of defection increase due to the the enforcement through international arbitral bodies or tribunals, due to the reputational mechanism, retaliation or domestic mechanisms of compliance (municipal judiciary or mobilization and naming and shamming by groups). Thirdly, Legalization entails a specific form of discourse, requiring justification and persuasion in terms of applicable rules and pertinent facts. Legal discourse largely disqualifies arguments based solely on interests and preferences. 
Conjectures: (i) Hard-law as commitment mechanism is expected where cooperative benefits are high and the underlying incentive structure is mixed-motive; (ii) when uncertainty regard behaviour is high; (iii) in “club goods” such as common jurisdictions or alliances, given the screening properties of hard instruments; (iv) “locking-in” hypothesis: since hard-law entails a certain degree of delegation and sovereignity costs, one would expect more hard-law when the executive wants to “lock-in” some policies and “tie the hands” of future executives or other agencies (See Moravcsik 2000). 
2.      Reducing transaction costs 
Hard law may reduce the (ex post) transaction costs in two way. From a managerial perspective, delegation of the interpretation of and day to day activities related with the IA to centralized external entities reduces the transaction costs of constantly bargaining and deciding on these matters. Even with weak delegation [O,P, d or -], high precision and high obligation may provide for the same function, as its legal nature facilitates discussion through legal modes of discourse. From an adversarial perspective, hard law instruments (specially in the form [O,P,D] or [O,p,D]) materially reduce the costs of enforcement when compared to alternatives live persuasion, or coercion – for the “demandeurs”, i.e. states that have worked to obtain commitments from others. 
Conjectures: (i) demandeurs ought to prefer hard legalization if uncertainty regarding behaviour is high, especially in mixed-motive games, and with high defection costs; (ii) when “demandeurs” which to limit participation; (iii) “demandeurs” and other incumbents share the same preferences, but other domestic actors in the country of the former (e.g. elites) have different ones (“locking-in” hypothesis again{\ldots}). 
3.      Handling the problem of incomplete contracting 
Given bounded rationality and unescapable exogenous uncertainty, states can never write IAs that anticipate every contingency. Exogenous changes may then invite opportunistic behaviour, namely due to quasi-rent capture, and consequently dissuade relation-specific welfare enhancing investments. Regimes of the form (O,p,D] are clearly designed with this purpose in mind: they utilize administrative and judicial institutions to interpret and extend broad legal principles. 
Conjecture: One can hypothesize that states will grant such authority when the anticipated gains from cooperation are large and there is reasonable consensus on general principles, but specific applications are difficult to anticipate 
Advantages of soft-law 
4.      Contracting cost 
Soft-law instruments reduce contracting costs in two ways. Firstly, given the expected lower sovereignty costs initial the negotiation costs, that is cost of arriving at an IA within everybody's preference set, become lower. Similarly, in complex and uncertain areas prone to exogenous shocks, soft legalization allows for minimizing the (expected) renegotiation costs. 
Conjecture: (i) soft legalization to reduce contracting costs ought to be more expected in agreements with high distributional problems; (ii) soft legalization to reduce renegotiation costs ought to be more expected in IAs with high uncertainty regarding the state of the world. 
5.      Sovereignty costs 
 Accepting a legally binding commitment leads to sovereignty costs to states, namely due to potential delegate drift, inferior outcomes, encroachment on state sovereignty etc. Sovereignty costs will be low if states limit their behaviour only in an ad hoc way. Greater costs will appear when delegation over relatively abstract decision-making power occurs, the largest example being the EU. Sovereignty costs are at their highest when international arrangements impinge on the relations between a state and its citizens or territory, the traditional hallmarks of (Westphalian) sovereignty. In line with this, sovereignity costs will vary greatly according to issue-area. At one extreme, sovereignty costs are especially high in areas related to national security[1]. In economic matters, sovereignity costs will tend to be negatively correlated with the technical nature of the issue; however, issues such as taxation, investment policy, money laundering etc. still entail high SC. Trade issues range between these extremes-sovereignty costs are significant but are frequently outweighed by the perceived benefits of legalized agreements. 
Conjecture: the higher the SCs the lower the softer is the legalization expected to be. 
6.      Uncertainty 
And here the authors seem to be talking about uncertainty regarding the state of the world. Namely, uncertainty meaning that because of being a new challenge or a complex one, the IA is prone to unaccounted for exogenous shock which will alter the original bargained distribution of costs and benefits. First, uncertainty about the state of the world makes precision not only desirable, as a way of increasing the flexibility of the agreement and lowering renegotiation costs, but also unattainable. A second way of reducing this uncertainty is to keep precision high but making the rules non-binding. This allows for states to obtain the benefits of the cooperation and enough flexibility to avoid the costs in case of an unaccounted for exogenous shock. Thirdly, moderate delegation, typically involving merely political and administrative bodies, provides another way for managing uncertainty as these agencies have the capacity to provide information and expertise while allowing for enough flexibility. 
Conjecture: more uncertainty regarding the state of the world, less legalization. 
7.      Soft-law as a tool of compromise 
Compromise over time – that is between patient states (low discount rates) and impatient states (high discount rate). 
Compromise between the weak and the strong – “Viewed as a process, legalization is a form of political bargaining where powerful states are advantaged. However, the efficiency gains of legalization for the powerful-cynically, providing an efficient means to extract benefits from the weak-depend on their offering the weak sufficiently satisfactory terms to induce their participation. Viewed as an outcome, legalization appears less political, since even powerful states must accept the constraints of legal principles and discourse to take advantage of legalized arrangements. Yet powerful states have the greatest influence on the substantive legal rules, and the institutions associated with (soft) international legalization are frequently constructed to ensure them a leading voice.” 



[1] affairs. Therefore it is unsur- prising that even in NATO, the most institutionalized alliance ever, delegation is moderate, {\{}O,p,dj, or that security arrangements have lagged behind other institu- tional developments in the EU. Similarly, bilateral arms control agreements like SALT can be very precise in specifying missile numbers and types and are unquestionably legally binding but are only minimally institutionalized.}},

abstract = {International financial law is in many ways a peculiar instrument of global economic affairs. Unlike international trade and monetary affairs, where global coordination is directed through formal international organizations, international financial law arises through inter-agency institutions with ambiguous legal status. Furthermore, the commitments made by regulatory officials participating in such forums are non-binding. This divergence is perplexing, especially when comparing international financial law to international trade. Both trade and finance comprise key areas of ‘international economic law' and their rules have important distributive consequences for global markets and market participants. This article suggests that in order to understand soft law's value as a coordinating mechanism, an institutional assessment of the way that law is enforced is necessary. Under close inspection, international financial law departs from traditional public international law notions of informality and can in fact be ‘harder' than its soft-law quality suggests. This feature helps explain why international financial rules, though technically non-binding, are often relied upon. The predominance of international soft law in finance does not, however, imply that it is without flaws, and this article highlights important structural deficiencies that the World Trade Organization, a more mature legal regime, largely avoids.},

A formal commitment could increase credibility by signaling an intention to come to the aid of another state or by creating commitment by altering the costs and benefits of such intervention. In this review, I lay out three considerations in a decision to intervene in a war. Signals require some costs to trasmit information, and I examine some possible costs in alliances. A state's willingness to intervene could be enhanced by audience costs for failure to honor a commitment. Neorealist arguments about alliances are flawed in asserting that security is a public good and in failing to realize that all states have both status quo and revisionist interests. This review surveys a number of smaller topics in alliances—the tradeoff between arms and allies, burden sharing, alliance management and duration, nonsecurity benefits, and domestic politics.},

abstract = {How does variation in the strength of a court's jurisdiction and enforcement affect strategic behavior by states involved in international disputes? The authors construct a formal model and identify three important ways that legal institutions can have a deleterious effect on international cooperation by magnifying the bargaining problems arising from incomplete information about the quality of the legal claims. First, strong courts create less information revelation in pretrial bargaining. Second, strong courts reduce the likelihood of pretrial settlements between states. Third, strong courts lead to more brinksmanship over high-value assets, which leads to conflict if the court refuses to intervene. The authors argue that a key policy implication of their model is that attempts to strengthen international courts must be accompanied by increased precision of international law to ameliorate the deleterious effects of strong courts.},

Nevertheless, a campaign against the agreement that was initiated by a small number of citizen groups was successful in stopping its ratification in the European Union (EU). This result is puzzling because the anti-ACTA side controlled few material resources and should have found it difficult to have its voice heard on an issue negotiated at the international level. We explain the success of the anti-ACTA campaign by showing how interest groups managed to increase the public salience of the issue; how the increasing public salience motivated a growing number of interest groups to mobilize; and how the resulting dynamic made decision-makers opt against ratification of the agreement.

abstract = {In 1919 President Woodrow Wilson famously called for a system of “open covenants..... openly arrived at.” He may not quite have lived up to his own aspirations, but the idea that international law-making should be an open and transparent process has proved a very sturdy implant. This chapter is particularly concerned with transparency as it affects international law-making. More specifically, we will consider transparency mainly from the stand-point of multilateral treaty negotiation but the points made here are equally relevant to other forms, including soft-law declarations and resolutions. At the outset it is worth asking why we should examine the principle of transparency in international law-making. At the domestic level there exists an obvious need to justify and legitimise the laws, policies, and decisions of public bodies in a democratic state accountable to the electorate. Modern legislatures are transparent insofar as they normally allow some degree of public access, and their proceedings are televised and reported by the press. One writer suggests that transparency has ‘attained quasi-religious significance in debate over governance and institutional design.' In this context the role of transparency is to contribute to democratic accountability and public participation in governance, while facilitating free speech and freedom of information about law-making and public affairs. On the international level where the interchange is primarily between States and the law-making institutions are not meaningfully democratic, it might be thought that transparency is less necessary; indeed it may even be seen as counter-productive in what is essentially a negotiating process. No negotiator would wish to reveal their position ahead of any dialogue. Some may feel it necessary to conceal their true position even after negotiations have concluded, if only to sustain illusions on both sides. Plainly, there are limits to the utility of transparency and its virtues must be balanced against other potential drawbacks. In politics, as in life, complete openness is rarely beneficial or desirable.},
annote = {a) Why it matters?

A good descriptive and normative analysis of the causes and impact of transparency in international lawmaking in general. In particular, It assesses the role of transparency in bargaining.

b) Methodology

Non-rational choice, doctrinal and historical analysis.

c) Main takeaways

Contrary to domestic politics, the case for transparency in international lawmaking involves some costs and benefits. On the cost side, transparency may make negotiations between states harder. On the benefit side, it allows form an increase in legitimacy which may facilitate compliance.

Participation in the process of international law-making

One of the mosst striking features of moder internationa law-making is the interaction and participation of states, international organizations and NGOs. The participation of the latter is particularly relevant for transparency since actors such as NGOs may difuse information on the negotiations.

However, there are few rules/principals on matters such as "who gets to participate in treaty negotiations". What we have is a set of practices which developed through time: (i) multilateral treaty-making at the UN is open to all states - so non-participation is a matter of choice and not of quality; (ii) for IOs associated with law-making, their constitutive acts tends to outline participation; (iii) NGOs have become active players in many multilateral negotiations to such an extent that in some cases such negotiations are largely driven by coalitions of NGOs and states - still, one cannot talk about a generalized right to participate; moreover, different categories of NGO status (general, special and "roster") determine the level of participation (Chinkin 1998 PROCURAR!!); among the areas of international law, the most restrictive seem to be trade law and non-proliferation law, with the WTO and the Atomic Energy Agency having extremely restrictive practices regarding NGO participation. The same applies for giving the right to "observer status to NGOs" (See pp 202-203 for a list of treaties which allow for it - most seem to be international environmental law).

Deliberative law-making process and transparency

Transparent deliberation in international law-making basically means transparent bargaining and drafting of international rules. Examples such as the negotiations of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 as well as several climate negotiations (see copenhagen, Cancun, and Durban in 2010-2011).
The world Health Organization (WHO), however, made the negotiations artificially opaque to avoid the tobacco lobbying industry from undermining the negotiation of the framework convention on tobacco control see pp. 240. For a theoretical argument in favor of secrecy due to rent-seeking see (Koremenos..."open covenants..").

Access to information

The authors claim that while it is by no means the rule, access to information on international law-making has increased. In part, they argue, this has been caused by technological change - namely access to documentation online. The full travaux preparatpores are now in most cases quickly accessible online. However, they point out, the travaux preparatoires will never give the complete picture of the negotiation process.

@article{Hollyer2014,
abstract = {Transparency is often viewed as crucial to government accountability, but its measurement remains elusive. This concept encompasses many dimensions, which have distinct effects. In this article, we focus on a specific dimension of transparency: governments' collection and dissemination of aggregate data. We construct a measure of this aspect of transparency, using an item response model that treats transparency as a latent predictor of the reporting of data to the World Bank's World Development Indicators. The resultant index covers 125 countries from 1980 to 2010. Unlike some alternatives (e.g., Freedom House), our measure—the HRV index—is based on objective criteria rather than subjective expert judgments. Unlike newspaper circulation numbers, HRV reflects the dissemination of credible content—in that it has survived the World Bank's quality control assessment. In a validation exercise, we find that our measure outperforms newspaper circulation as a predictor of Law and Order and Bureaucratic Quality as measured by the ICRG, particularly in autocracies. It performs as well as newspaper circulation in predicting corruption. These findings suggest that data dissem-ination is a distinct, and politically relevant, form of transparency. Transparency, as broadly defined, relates to the full flow of information within a polity. A lengthy literature stresses the importance of the provision of information to the populace to ensure the accountability of government, and thus emphasizes the role of transparency as a determinant of gov-ernment performance (see, for instance,Adser{\`{a}} , Boix, and Payne 2003; Besley and Burgess 2002). This broad notion of transparency may encompass many different forms of information trans-mission. Common proxies for transparency measure aspects of the media market, the presence/ absence of freedom of information laws (FOILs), or even political institutions such as democracy. A smaller portion of the literature considers an alternative dimension of transparency: the govern-ment's collection and dissemination of aggregate economic data. In this article, we introduce a novel measure of this last dimension of transparency. To construct this measure, we rely on a Bayesian item response (IRT) model, which treats transparency (along},

We argue that the relationships between judges and other policy makers in separation-of-powers systems are central to understanding this puzzle. Opinion vagueness can reflect efforts to resolve core tradeoffs associated with judicial policymaking that bear some resemblance to standard accounts of political delegation. Vagueness offers judges the ability to manage their uncertainty over policy outcomes and to hide likely defiance from public view. At the same time, vagueness removes a central source of pressure for compliance that judges can place on other policy makers. Using a game-theoretic model, we identify conditions under which judges use vagueness precisely as legislatures use statutory discretion. We also demonstrate conditions under which judges use vagueness in ways unanticipated by standard delegation accounts.},

Ranging from simple oral deals to detailed executive agreements, they permit states to conclude profitable bargains without the formality of treaties. They differ from treaties in more than just a procedural sense. Treaties are designed, by long-standing convention, to raise the credibility of promises by staking national reputation on their adherence. Informal agreements have a more ambiguous status and are useful for precisely that reason. They are chosen to avoid formal and visible national pledges, to avoid the political obstacles of ratification, to reach agreements quickly and quietly, and to provide flexibility for subsequent modification or even renunciation. They differ from formal agreements not because their substance is less important (the Cuban missile crisis was solved by informal agreement) but because the underlying promises are less visible and more equivocal. The prevalence of such informal devices thus reveals not only the possibilities of international cooperation but also the practical obstacles and the institutional limits to endogenous enforcement.},

Much theorizing about norms has focused on how they create social structure, standards of appropriateness, and stability in international politics. Recent empirical research on norms, in contrast, has examined their role in creating political change, but change processes have been less well-theorized. We induce from this research a variety of theoretical arguments and testable hypotheses about the role of norms in political change. We argue that norms evolve in a three-stage "life cycle" of emergence, "norm cascades," and internalization, and that each stage is governed by different motives, mechanisms, and behavioral logics. We also highlight the rational and strategic nature of many social construction processes and argue that theoretical progress will only be made by placing attention on the connections between norms and rationality rather than by opposing the two.},
