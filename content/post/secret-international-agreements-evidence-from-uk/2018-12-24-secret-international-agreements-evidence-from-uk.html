<h1>“Sykes-Picot”, Trotsky, and the Prohibition Against Secret International Agreements</h1>
<p>Following its 100th birthday, the <em>Sykes-Picot Agreement</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, officially known as the <em>Asia Minor Agreement</em>, re-entered the public sphere mostly due to its legacy<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<figure class="image">

<p>In this agreement, which received its name from being negotiated by the British diplomat Mark Sykes and its french counter-part Francois Georges-Picot, the British and French powers (later assented by the Russian Empire) covertly agreed on how the falling Ottoman Empire should be carved out. The lines drawn still shape parts of modern middle east.</p>

<p>There is, however, a aspect of this international agreement that is less discussed: the secrecy of its making. This aspect was as relevant then as it is now.</p>

<h2>“Trotsky-leaks” and its impact on public opinion</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular expectations, the registration (and even ratification) of international agreements was a mid- to late-20th century novelty<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Before, secret international agreements were a very common tool of international relations. <em>Secret diplomacy</em> was, well, <em>diplomacy</em>. And, as such, the <em>status-quo</em>. This would soon change.</p>
<p>It’s 1917. Enter Leon Trotsky, Foreign Affairs Commissar to the novel Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Upon getting access to the Tsarist foreign relations files, the new incumbent finds a memorandum containing the text of the <em>Sykes-Picot Agreement</em>, by then assented by the previous Russian Empire. And with it, evidence of <em>secret diplomacy</em> with large implications as well as of possible double-dealing by the imperial powers - “<em>[evidence of]…France and Britain as duplicitous in relation to the Arabs</em>”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<figure class="image">

<p>Possibly due to the embarrassment it could cause to the imperial powers, or due to the Russian claims to the former Ottoman empire being denied in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution. The Commissariat disclosed the complete agreement in Russian newspapers, the <em>Izvestia</em> and <em>Pravda</em>, on 23 November 1917; subsequently, the <em>Manchester Guardian</em> printed the texts on November 26, 1917.</p>

<p>Not too dissimilar from the leaked diplomatic-cables following <em>Wikileaks</em>, the leaked secret treaties caused great agitation after being re-published in most major newspapers: “<em>Public opinion in Europe and beyond was &quot;deeply shocked&quot; by the knowledge that the major powers had promised one thing in public while they agreed to something else in private</em>.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Some historians have argued that the public reaction to the disclosures impacted the North-American President Woodrow Wilson<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and were reflected on his famous <em>Fourteen Points Speech</em><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>, his <em>“programme of the world’s peace”</em>, on its first point calling for <em>open covenants, openly arrived at</em> and for no <em>private international understandings of any kind</em>.</p>

<p>Amidst this climate of contestation, many called for more transparency in international lawmaking, with positions ranging from open-door negotiations to more minimalist rules such as the mandatory publication of international agreements<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>. Positions clustering around the latter were crystallized in two rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Article 18, Covenant of the League of Nations</strong>, which read: “<em>Every treaty or international engagement entered into hereafter by any Member of the League shall be forthwith registered with the Secretariat and shall as soon as possible be published by it. No such treaty or international engagement shall be binding until so registered.</em>”</li>
</ul>
<p>And, later-on, at the United Nations…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Article 102, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations</strong> stating that: “<em>Every treaty and every international agreement entered into by any Member of the United Nations after the present Charter comes into force shall as
soon as possible be registered with the Secretariat and published by it.</em>”; and in its <strong>paragraph 2</strong>: “<em>No party to any such treaty or international agreement which has not been registered in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article may invoke that treaty or agreement before any organ of the United Nations.</em>”.</li>

<h1>Some theory: why write it down? or why secret treaties are quite puzzling</h1>
<div id="starting-point-a-very-brief-intro-to-compliance-theory" class="section level2">
<h2>Starting point: a (very) brief intro to compliance theory</h2>
<p>For rationalist accounts of international cooperation, secret international agreements ought to be quite puzzling.</p>
<p>According to these models, the credibility and enforceability of an agreement seem to rely, in one way or another, on a certain degree of information being made available to various key actors.</p>
<p>In particular, from this viewpoint, there seems to be four main rationales for stable international cooperation in the absence of a central enforcer:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The agreement is <strong>self-enforcing</strong> (e.g. pure coordination game - <em>i.e.</em> no party has an incentive to defect, think of standardization agreements…);</p></li>
<li><p>States fear suffering <strong>reputational costs</strong> which may endanger future cooperation <span class="citation">(e.g. Brewster 2009; Guzman 2008)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reciprocity</strong> and fear of retaliatory action <span class="citation">(Axelrod 2006)</span> (think of trade agreements..);</p></li>
<li><p>Or through domestic (or international) <strong>enforcement and domestic audience costs</strong>, namely through the judiciary branch <span class="citation">(Powell and Staton 2009)</span>, international adjudicating bodies, or political pressure and mobilization by domestic constituencies, such as voters, lobbies, or NGOs<span class="citation">(Dai 2005; Simmons 2009)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="the-puzzle-most-mechanisms-of-compliance-are-not-applicable-to-secret-treaties-so-why-bother" class="section level2">
<h2>The puzzle: most mechanisms of compliance are not applicable to secret treaties, so why bother?</h2>
<p>However, most of these mechanisms are extremely feeble in the realm of secret international agreements (SIAs):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>reputational mechanism</strong> will become weaker since defections are now private information hidden from domestic and external audiences. Being so, third-States will not be able to update their beliefs about the type of the defector which will then decrease the expected reputational costs of a defection.</p></li>
<li><p>The scope for <strong>retaliation</strong> and for <em>tit-for-tat</em> is also narrower in SIAs. Retaliatory action outside of the scope of the agreement, e.g. sanctions or a sudden aversion to cooperation with the defector in other issue-areas, may increase the risk of detection of the SIA by domestic and external audiences, as they are highly visible and need parliamentary approval at times (e.g. sanctions).</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, it is hard to see how one would enforce these agreements through <strong>domestic or international adjudicating bodies</strong><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>;</p></li>
<li><p>or how a defecting state may be deterred by the expected <strong>domestic audience costs</strong> of breaking a promise that is not known by those very same audiences and constituencies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And so, here’s our conundrum:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>why would states engage in the costs of formalizing secret promises into international agreements if no benefits may be obtained therefrom in terms of credibility or enforceability? </em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Why not resort to</em>, as Machiavelli advises<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, <em>“verbal agreements” instead?</em><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>

<h1>Empirical analysis of UK’s unpublished International Agreements</h1>
<div id="preparing-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Preparing the data</h2>
<p>The dataset contains <span class="math inline">\(13,576\)</span> international agreements, as well as their relevant metadata, concluded by the United Kingdom. It includes bi- and multi-lateral instruments of various forms - ranging from <em>exchange of letters</em> and <em>MoU</em>s to <em>conventions</em>.</p>
<p>The oldest international agreement in our dataset is the <em>Treaty of Defensive Alliance between Great Britain and Portugal</em>, and it was signed on May 16th, 1703; whereas the most recent, <em>Bilateral Agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States of America on Prudential Measures regarding Insurance and Reinsurance</em> , was signed on December the 18th, 2018.</p>
<p>The data was exported from FCO’s treaty database using the <a href="https://treaties.fco.gov.uk/responsive/app/consolidatedSearch/#search/v=list,c=1,q=qs%3D%5Bnotes%20OR%20agreement%20OR%20treaty%20OR%20letter%20OR%20memorandum%20OR%20convention%20OR%20protocol%20OR%20Notes%20OR%20Agreement%20OR%20Treaty%20OR%20Letter%20OR%20Memorandum%20OR%20Convention%20OR%20Protocol%20NOT%20%20Series%5D%2CqueryType%3D%5B64%5D,sm=s,l=library2_lib,a=t">following query</a>.</p>

<h3>Data wrangling</h3>
<p>We finish up by cleaning up the data. First, we clean up some string variables and turn all dates into <code>date</code> format using the <code>lubridate</code> package. Next, we keep only treaties which were concluded by the united kingdom, and not by, say, a colony for simplicity sake. Finally, we remove the united kingdom from the <code>country</code> variable since that is not informative.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>require(lubridate)

sia_uk &lt;- sia_uk %&gt;% ## keep only treaties concluded by the UK (not, say, a colony)
  filter(str_detect(country, regex(&quot;\\;\\s{1,}united\\s+kingdom&quot;, ignore_case = TRUE))) %&gt;%
  mutate_if(is.character, str_trim) %&gt;%
  mutate(date_of_signature = lubridate::dmy(date_of_signature),
         adopted_date = dmy(adopted_date),
         def_eif_date = dmy(def_eif_date),
         terminated_date = lubridate::dmy(terminated_date),
         country = str_to_lower(country),
         country= str_remove(country, &quot;\\;\\s{1,}united\\s+kingdom&quot;) %&gt;%
           str_replace_all(., &quot;(?&lt;=[a-z]|;)\\s{2,}|\\s{2,}(?=[a-z]|;)&quot;, &quot; &quot;) %&gt;%
           str_trim())</code></pre>
<p>Next, we tidy up the data. In a tidy dataset (i) each variable must have its own column; (ii) each observation must have its own row; (iii) each value must have its own cell.</p>
<figure class="image">
<img src='/img/tidy.jpg#center' width=600'>
<figcaption>
The logic of tidy data (Hadley Wickham &amp; Garrett Grolemund)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is not the case in this dataset. Observations, namely the state-parties to the agreements, are clustered in one cell. And so, we will have to split up the <code>country</code> variable and then add the remaining rows.</p>
<p>Below you will find a, admittedly, <em>hacky</em> way of going around this problem. We split the country vector using a <em>regular expression</em> for &quot; ; &quot; and add the document id, replicated by the number of appearances of the split-pattern &quot; ; &quot;, and use the id to <code>left_join()</code> the remaining dataset.</p>
<p>Party-level data increases the number of observations to <span class="math inline">\(111,772\)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_sia &lt;- tibble(unlist(str_split(sia_uk$country, &quot;\\s+;\\s+&quot;))) %&gt;%
  set_names(&quot;counter_party&quot;) %&gt;% 
  mutate(document_id = rep(sia_uk$document_id, sapply(str_split(sia_uk$country, &quot;\\s+;\\s+&quot;), 
                                                      length))) %&gt;% 
  left_join(., sia_uk) 

nrow(tidy_sia)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 111772</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we standardize the country names using the, surprisingly useful for public international lawyers, <code>countrycode::countrycode()</code> function. Because running this function on <span class="math inline">\(100,000+\)</span> observations would take a lot of time, I will run it only on a new data frame with the unique counter party names, standardize them,<code>left_join()</code> it into the main dataset, and assign it to a new object.</p>

<h2>Exploratory data analysis 1: UK treaty practice</h2>
<p>Let’s explore the dataset a bit.</p>
<p>A first question to ask is <strong>who are UKs most frequent cooperative partners?</strong> This can be answered by mapping UK’s treaty-making.</p>
<p>The first step for building a map of UK’s treaty-making is get each counter-parties central coordinates. Going to use <code>ggplot2</code>’s <code>map_data</code> the coordinates data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>geo_data &lt;- map_data(&quot;world&quot;) %&gt;%
  as_tibble() %&gt;%
  select(stand_country = region, long, lat, group) %&gt;%
  mutate(stand_country = countrycode(stand_country, &quot;country.name&quot;, &quot;country.name.en&quot;, origin_regex = TRUE)) </code></pre>
<p>To map the frequency of treaty-making with the UK we first have to generate a world map using the entire geo_data dataset - this can be achieved through a <code>geom_polygon()</code>. To capture the distribution of the relevant count variable, I will colour each country depending on the number of IAs they concluded with the UK (lighter colours meaning less, and darker more).</p>

<p>We can see from the map that the top-5 repeat players are European. A distant outlier, it’s <strong>France</strong>, with <span class="math inline">\(2898\)</span> IAs followed by <strong>the Netherlands</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(2045\)</span>), <strong>Belgium</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(1961\)</span>), <strong>Italy</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(1936\)</span>), and <strong>Germany</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(1923\)</span>).</p>

<p>We can repeat the process below to get the gist of the frequency of international agreements by subject, as defined by the FCO. What we find is not surprising, since subject-areas such as <strong>taxation</strong>, <strong>aviation</strong>, <strong>debt</strong>, and <strong>investment protection</strong> were, and some still are, overwhelmingly bilateral.</p>

<p>The plots suggest, unsurprisingly, that the 20th century was indeed the <em>century of international law</em>. Also we observe that while the 19th and 20th century have a positive slope, the 21st century, with the exception of the interval 2008-2011, has a slightly decreasing slope.</p>
<p>This trend seems to be robust to type of <em>lateralism</em> of the international agreements.</p>

<h2>Exploratory data analysis 2: UK’s treaty-publicity practices</h2>
<p>Before delving into the publicity practices, it’s crucial to expand brie???y on the nature of the raw data to be used for coding them.</p>
<p>The <em>FCO Treaties Database</em> publishes each, known, international agreement concluded by the UK along with its relevant metadata such as date of signature, a “lateralism type” indicator, parties, place of signature, and, more relevantly, <strong>publication records</strong> - .<em>i.e.</em> where it was published.</p>
<p>In this dataset, treaties are often published in more than one source. We will have to tidy it up.</p>

<p>Above, we see where each of our international agreements were published according to FCO’s database.</p>
<p>Most of them were registered by the <strong>League of Nations</strong> or the <strong>UN treaty registry</strong>. Domestically, we find many different sources but most were at least published at the <strong>Treaty Series</strong>, <strong>PRO Records</strong>, and at the <strong>Command Papers</strong> (<em>government publications</em>).</p>
<p>More relevantly, <span class="math inline">\(879\)</span> international agreements were marked as <strong>Not Published</strong> by the FCO. Below I will explore the characteristics of these agreements.</p>
<p>Looking into <strong>lateralism</strong>, there seem to be two theoretical reasons to expect the majority of unpublished international agreements to be bilateral rather than multilateral.</p>
<p>First, multilateralism in the absence of strict reciprocity, <em>Olsonean</em> “privileged groups”, or an Hegemon, may enhance enforcement problems since, the ratio of individual benefts obtained from
enforcing the agreement is expected to decrease as the number of parties increases and this may induce the <strong>free-ridding of enforcement efforts</strong>. Thus, parties are expected to resort to more “compliance-robust” forms of cooperation and public agreements, for the reasons explained above, all things equal, should be more cooperation inducive than hidden ones.</p>
<p>Secondly, because the probability of a “hidden” agreement being accidentally, or purposefully, disclosed should be higher as the number of parties increases.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, our data seems to provide some suggestive support to this.</p>

<p><strong>Trade</strong>, <strong>loans and credits</strong>, <strong>defence</strong>, and <strong>financial compensation</strong> matters appearing as the four most frequent issues of unpublished international agreements is reasonable given the frequent strict-reciprocity between cooperative parties in these matters (think trade and defence), which should facilitate de enforceability and credibility of the promisses. Similarly, another possible explanations stems from these areas being prone to politically sensitive promisses.</p>
<p>On this last point, we find in our data politically sensitive agreements such as agreements on war trade with non-allies during the second world war, such as the agreement concluded with Portugal on 1942, and weapons and intelligence sharing agreements.</p>
<p>To get the general idea of the content of these agreements we can tokenize their title, remove all stop words, and compute the <strong>inverse document frequency</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\text{IDF}_{word_i} = \ln(\frac{n_{\text{subject-area}}}{n_{\text{subject-area with word}_{i}}})\)</span>) of each term, by subject, to find the more idosyncratic terms of each subject-area.</p>

<p>In the beggining of this post we talked about of how there seems to have been a norm- and legal-change regarding covert international agreements. This raises several questions, the main being: <em>did the prohibitions against secret international agreements actually work</em>?</p>
<p>Before going further, I want to point out that this analysis is purely exploratory. The world is complex and full of co-variation, and plotting time-trends without controling for any of this complexity doesn’t provide us with enough information. Still, it’s something interesting to explore.</p>
<p>We start by plotting the number of international agreement by whether they were <strong>published</strong>, <strong>not published</strong>, or <strong>publication status unknown</strong> across the entire time-period covered by our data. The <strong>red dotted-line marks the birth of the League of Nations</strong>, and of <strong>Art. 18</strong> of its Covenant; and the <strong>black dotted-line marks the birth of the United Nations</strong> along with <strong>Art. 102</strong> of its Charter.</p>
<p>While we are unable to get any information on the impact of the norm change at this scale, there are a couple of interesting things happening here. In the case of the UK, one observes that until late-19th century and the beggining of the 20th there seems to have been a general practice of publicizing its international agreements. As one reaches the years leading to <em>WW1</em>, we observe a relatively steep increase in the proportion of unpublished international agreements. This is in line with the inter-war <em>realpolitik</em> which marked the period.</p>

<p>The plot seems to be in line with current research. In a fantastic and highly detailed historical analysis, Megan Donaldson looked into the <em>survival of the secreat treaty</em> following birth of the League of Nations and United Nations. According to her archival research the expected norm-change towards “open covenants, openly arrived at” was never fully realized: <em>Even if democracies make relatively few secret treaties, the overall workings of treaty-making offer a contrast with the hopes of 1919</em><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>We do not observe any relevant change in the amount of unpublished agreements being concluded following the birth of the league of nations. Furthermore, as we approach its collapse and the years leading to the second world war, we see a spike in covert treaty-making. This trend decreases slightly following the approval of <strong>Art. 102</strong> of the Charter but just to increase again, reaching the maxima of the curve in the two years following it. After 1948 we observe a gradual decline of unpublished international agreements and an increase in the number of published international agreements. Still, <strong>the secret treaty survives</strong>.</p>
<p>Yet, empirically disantangling the effect of the emergence of the <em>prohibition against secret international agreements</em> requires a more thorough and not purely descriptive analysis. These are just the first steps.</p>
