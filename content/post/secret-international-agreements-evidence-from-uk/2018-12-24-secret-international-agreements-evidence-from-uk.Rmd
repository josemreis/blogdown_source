## Sykes-Picot, Trotsky, and the Prohibition Against Secret International Agreements

Following its 100th birthday, the *Sykes-Picot Agreement*^[You can read the content of the treaty at Yale\'s (fantastic) [Avalon Project website](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/sykes.asp).], officially known as the *Asia Minor Agreement*, re-entered the public sphere mostly due to its looming legacy^[*e.g.* see [Middle East still rocking from first world war pacts made 100 years ago](https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/dec/30/middle-east-still-rocking-from-first-world-war-pacts-made-100-years-ago)].

And it is understandable why. In this agreement, which received its name from being negotiated by the british diplomat Mark Sykes and its french counter-part Francois Georges-Picot, the British and French powers (later assented by the Russian Empire) covertly agreed on how the falling Ottoman Empire should be carved out. The lines drawn still shape modern middle east.

There is, however, a aspect of this international agreement: the secrecy of its making.
