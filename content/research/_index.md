In a time when transparency in foreign policy has attracted much debate, one is surprised to fnd the scarcity of theoretical and empirical scholarship exploring the role of transparency and secrecy in International Law.

In the Public International Law landscape, we observe that most scholars tend to treat crucial dimensions of transparency as mere formalities, and that the few analyses of the topic usually focus on its normative implications but seldomly engage with the positive ones.


In the International Relations landscape, we observe a far more comprehensive treatment. Still, some issues tend to be overlooked. For example, the publicity of an international agreement, a crucial dimension of institutional-choice, has largely been ignored in empirical research. Similarly, several theories of compliance with international law, such as reputational and domestic mechanisms, rely on information about state
behaviour being diffused and available to non-treaty and non-state parties. However, there is little systematic empirical evidence backing it up across regimes.


This dissertation attempts to provide a systematic treatment of several crucial, albeit relatively understudied, dimensions of the topic. It attempts to do so by asking one overarching question: _what explains the preferences for and impact of transparency (or lack of) in international cooperation through public international law mechanisms?_


This broad-research question will then be broken into smaller ones in each chapter of the dissertation, each addressing relevant dimensions of transparency during the formation and enforcement of international agreements. Asking in particular:

* When and why do states disclose information regarding ongoing negotiations of international agreements?
* What drives the publicity (or secrecy) of international agreements?
* What explains the variations in rules and practices regarding the access to compliance information by non-treaty and non-state parties across regimes?
* What explains the inter-adjudicating body and intra-adjudicating body variations of "procedural transparency" in international disputes?

### Transparency in International Negotiations - Evidence from EU International Lawmaking

Following the controversy surrounding the negotiations of the Transatlantic
Trade and Investment Partnership, transparency in international negotiations has re-gained a central position in policy debates. And while normative literature on the topic afloats, we know very little about when and how often information about ongoing negotiations is actually produced, as well as what its correlates may be.


Using an original dataset composed with document disclosures related with the negotiations of 459 concluded EU-third state international agreements between 1999 - 2018 ($N = 3, 565$), this paper looks into what influences the probability of an international negotiations-related document being disclosed by the Council of the European Union. 

In opposition to previous findings, we find no robust evidence for variations in transparency outcomes across central issue-areas. As for the document originator, we find that documents produced by the European Commission are more likely to be available to the public than documents produced by other EU bodies such as the European Council secretariat or Presidency. Finally, looking into bargaining dynamics and decision-making rules we find evidence suggesting: (i) that documents associated with international agreements containing issue-linkages are significantly less likely to be disclosed; (ii) and that memberstate position polarization, proxied with the number of days it took the Council to adopt the agreement, has a negative effect on the probability of a document being disclosed only if the European Parliament has veto-power.


### Opening Up International Adjudication - Mapping Procedural Transparency in International Disputes

(_work in progress_)

It is often argued that "under anarchy" states must create international institutions to manage uncertainty and to enhance compliance with international norms. International institutions facilitate cooperation via the production and dissemination of information regarding states' behaviour. Information on compliance may lead to reputational costs, to potential retaliations by agreement-peers, or mobilization by domestic actors or transnational actors. Among many other key-actors, international adjudicating bodies have traditionally been perceived as crucial "information clearing houses" which, through their rulings, hearings, and audio-visual coverage, diffuse information about states' compliance-behaviour. A necessary condition for these functionalist theories to hold seems to be the actual production of compliance information via international adjudication. Yet, very little is known about when or why "information production" actually occurs in international adjudication. It is often rather assumed or analysed from a de jure  perspective.


This working paper attempts to contribute to the literature on international law and international judiciary politics in two ways. First, from a de jure  perspective,  it provides a theoretically informed survey of procedural transparency rules at the main global adjudicators. Specifically,  by assessing design features which are expected to impact transparency outcomes: whether the rule is mandatory or a default-rule, status-quo option, agenda-setters and the scope for possible shifts from the status-quo, and the number veto-players. 


Secondly, by exploring a novel dataset measuring transparency outcomes at the dispute-level (e.g. access to pleadings/hearings or dispute-related press-releases) in 1380 disputes from ten different international adjudicating bodies. Using this data, we provide a novel and comprehensive map of de facto transparency in international adjudication across time, parties, and adjudicating bodies; and with it, a small empirical contribution to the larger debate on the legitimacy of international adjudicating bodies, and some of the first steps for a new research agenda of studying the correlates de facto transparency in international disputes.
